# plot-visualizer

The goal of this project is to develop an application, based on metrics, about countries. For the implementation of the code, we used the eclipse environment. On this app, we use the MySQL application to retrieve our data. Furthermore, we visualize data using javascript and Web Server for Chrome extension.

The following picture depicts the GUI of our application

As we can see, we can choose between three plots.
+ BarPlot
+ LinePlot
+ ScatterPlot
